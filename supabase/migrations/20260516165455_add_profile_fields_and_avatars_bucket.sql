/*
  # Add profile fields and avatars storage bucket

  1. Modified Tables
    - `profiles`
      - `full_name` (text, nullable) - User's display name
      - `avatar_url` (text, nullable) - Path to avatar image in storage
      - `phone` (text, nullable) - Optional contact phone number

  2. Storage
    - Create `avatars` bucket for user profile pictures
    - Public read access for all avatars
    - Authenticated users can upload/update/delete only their own avatar

  3. Notes
    - full_name is collected during signup and editable in profile
    - avatar_url stores the public URL of the uploaded image
    - Phone is optional and not required for registration
